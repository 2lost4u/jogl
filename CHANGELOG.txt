Changes between JOGL 1.0.0 and 1.1.0:

 - The glext.h and associated header files JOGL uses have been updated
   to OpenGL 2.1 with NVidia's GeForce 8 series extensions. The new
   functions are available as methods in the GL interface.

 - The developer build bundles have been changed to zip archives, so
   instead of having to download multiple jars, you can now just
   download the zip archive for your particular platform. The new zip
   archives are versioned with the build date.

 - The source distribution now contains the generated sources like
   GL.java, GLU.java, etc. for more convenient use in IDEs.

 - The chosen GLCapabilities are now exposed from the GLDrawable via
   GLDrawable.getChosenGLCapabilities(); this functionality works on
   all platforms even in cases where the GLCapabilitiesChooser is not
   supported, and attempts to provide correct answers so programs can
   make decisions based on the results.

 - The native code for the "DRI hack" (to support the open-source DRI
   drivers on Linux and other X11 platforms) has been removed; JOGL
   now uses the GlueGen NativeLibrary class for this purpose.

 - The GlueGen runtime classes have been removed from jogl.jar. These
   have been factored out into gluegen-rt.jar and are referenced by
   both the JOGL and JOAL projects.

 - The JOGL applet launcher now supports deployment of applets which
   use both OpenGL for 3D graphics via JOGL as well as OpenAL for
   spatialized audio via JOAL. It has been updated for the changes in
   the GlueGen runtime classes and native library structure. Some bugs
   have been fixed, some of which were preventing different JOGL-based
   applets from being deployed from the same codebase. The applet
   launcher has been updated for the change in native library
   structure. The documentation and on-line examples have been updated
   as well.

 - Various bug fixes were made to the GlueGen runtime and JOGL
   implementation.
